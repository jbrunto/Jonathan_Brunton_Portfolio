# Major Projects in Computational and Applied Data Science
A series of sprint-esque, multi-week projects in which 4-7 inter-academic course graduate co-developers develop machine learning applications of environmental datasets, culminating in the 'product release' and presentation to hypothetical clients and interest groups.

## Hurricane Forecasting with Computer Vision
*Motivation:* Given a set of satellite images of a hurricane, predict the hurricane's evolution.

*Proposed Solution:* A convolution LSTM and GAN-LSTM were separately trained and tested, both constructed in PyTorch. The former achieved better results in both image prediction (according to a customly developed evaluation metric specific to image pixel similarity) and computational cost. Some results are shown below

*Project Roles:* Lead developer of image preprocessing workflow, co-developer of convolutional LSTM workflow (architecture optimzation), documentation and code sustainability maintainer, lead presenter.


## Wildfire Forecasting and Correction
*Motivation:* Using time series of satellite imagery coupled with ground sensor data, develop a neural network to predict the evolution of the wildfire in simulated 'real-time'.

*Proposed Solution:* Principal Components Analysis (PCA) addressed issues of compressing and coupling the data, while an ensemble convolutional autoencoder-random forest regressor predicted wildfire image evolution in physical space. A Kalman filter was developed for the latent space of the autoencoder, correcting predictions in real-time. The images below show a comparison of the wildfire sensor ground truths and model predictions.

*Project Roles:* Lead PCA developer, co-developer of data assimilation workflow (filter tuning), Python project suite testing, lead presenter

## Flood evolution and cost-of-damage prediction
*Motivation:* Given historical flood data, local rainwater data, and property value estimates, classify the flood probability and predict cost of damages for every postcode in England.

*Proposed Solution:* Given the limited amount of data, leverage scientific principles to create new data features from the existing set. The cleaned, manipulated, and integrated dataset is sent to a multi-class model for flood probability. Each of the ten classes outputted by the model is the last input needed for a K-Nearest Neighbors regressor that predicts the corresponding damage cost. Screenshots of results from the classification model are shown in color, with damage cost in greyscale.
