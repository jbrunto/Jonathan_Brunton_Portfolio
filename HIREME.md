### Portfolio Guide:
For simplicity, this document does serve as a working version of the my project portfolio, but a clean .pdf version can also be found within the [Supporting Materials](./Supporting_Materials/). 
In addition to this portfolio, my additional public repositories include:

  - A dead version of my Master's [Capstone Project](https://github.com/jbrunto/Seismic_Machine_Learning), which is described in short [Below](Introduction).
