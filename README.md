## II. Thesis Project

*Motivation:* Traditional workflows for assessing a subsurface region's ability to store fluid require ample manual interpretation and destructive collection processes in addition to advanced seismic modeling. With next-generation velocity data recovered from Full-Waveform Inversion techniques of a subsurface region, we aim to automate the entirety of this workflow for fault systems specifically by:
- Extracting meaningful data features for a large, raw seismic reflectivity volume by leveraging advanced numerical methods
- Developing an unsupervised image clustering model to predict the locations of faults within the volume
- Combining and using the predicted volume with velocity data to create a 3D visualization tool and assess predicted fault's ability to store fluid.

### Machine Learning Model Development
Initial steps were taken to clean and transform raw seimic reflectivity image data into a numerically derived coherency volume using 3D interpretation. 2D, 'stackable' images of these transformations were sent to be trained on a K-Means clustering model, which was developed to highlight large, 3D discontinuities within the volume. Only data with viable intra-cluster intertia values were selected for the final predicted fault locations. This process is shown below, left-to-right
